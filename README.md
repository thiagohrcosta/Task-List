## Objective
This project was initiated with the primary objective of advancing proficiency in handling conditionals, functions, and loops within a programming context to build a dynamic Task list application. 

The application allows users to seamlessly create, read, update, and delete tasks, providing a versatile solution for task management. 

The implementation not only addresses these fundamental programming constructs but also integrates a set of concise helper functions, following the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle. These auxiliary functions significantly enhance the modularity and maintainability of the codebase, fostering a clean and efficient development process.
